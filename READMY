Project goal: Develop a system for collecting and processing weather data.
The system consists of two parts: a RESTful API service for filtering and
sorting weather data (hereinafter referred to as the “server”), as well as at least one service,
providing weather data (hereinafter referred to as “sensor”).
The sensor is an application that can register itself
on server. Then, at certain intervals, the sensor reports
weather data to the server. The server receives data from the sensor and stores it in
DB. The client can receive data from the server about available sensors and measurements
weather.

Available endpoints
POST endpoints:
http://localhost:8080/sensors/registration - Registering the sensor on the server
http://localhost:8080/sensors/{key}/measurements - Weather Data Logging
{key} - unique sensor key

GET endpoints:
http://localhost:8080/sensors - Retrieving all active sensors
http://localhost:8080/sensors/{key}/measurements - Retrieving the last 20 sensor measurements
http://localhost:8080/sensors/measurements - Request to receive up-to-date information from all sensors.
